SharedModule contains code that will be used across your feature modules.

You only import the SharedModule into the specific feature modules.

Ensure you donâ€™t import the SharedModule into your AppModule or CoreModule.

Application-wide singleton services do not belong to the SharedModule, they should be in the CoreModule.

SharedModule is only for keeping common components, pipes & directives.

Layout component is a great example of a shared component
